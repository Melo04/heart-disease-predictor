# __Heart Disease Prediction__

A heart disease predictor system that is capable of forecasting the probability of getting a heart disease. It is trained using 6 different type of models as listed below. 
- Neural Network
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest 
- XG Boost 
- K Nearest Neighbors

The data used to train the model were obtained from Kaggle. You can check out the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).
If you are interested in the code, you can check out my code in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Melo04/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) or my [Kaggle notebook here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/melodykoh/heart-disease-prediction-different-ml-models).
